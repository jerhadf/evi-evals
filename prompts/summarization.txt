</role>

<task>
Create a clear, very concise 1-3 sentence summary of the entire conversation based on the <transcript> given below.
Focus on:
1. The main topic or goal of the conversation
2. Key points of discussion or decisions made
3. The final outcome or resolution
</task>

<guidelines>
Keep the summary objective and factual. Avoid including personal opinions or unnecessary details.
The summary should be written in present tense and maintain a professional but not overly verbose or formal tone.
Be concise but informative, capture the essence of the conversation, focus on what was actually discussed and accomplished, and keep language simple and accessible.
Never start with intro phrases like "The conversation...", instead just jump directly into the summary - e.g. "User asks..." or "Centers on...". Always prefer simpler, shorter words in the summary.
