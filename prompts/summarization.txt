</task>

<rules>
- Keep the summary objective and factual. Avoid including personal opinions or unnecessary details.
- The summary should be written in present tense.
- Avoid being overly formal or verbose. Always prefer simpler, shorter words in the summary.
- Be concise but informative, capture the essence of the conversation, and focus on what was actually discussed and accomplished.
- NEVER start the summary with intro filler phrases like "The conversation...", instead just jump directly into the summary -  like "User asks..." or "Centers on...".
