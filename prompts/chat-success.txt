Given the chat transcript and chat success description provided below, determine if the AI successfully achieved what the user needed.

Focus on:
1. Whether the specific goals in the success description were achieved (the success description is the user's answer to the question 'What is success for this chat?').
4. Any clear indicators of success/failure in the transcript, e.g. the user saying thank you, the AI completing the user's request, or the transcript accomplishing the success description.

Return:
- A status of "success" if the goals were clearly achieved according to the success description
- A status of "failure" if the goals were clearly not achieved
- A status of "unknown" if you cannot confidently determine success/failure

Povide clear but concise reasoning (2-5 sentences) explaining your assessment, citing specific evidence from the transcript.
